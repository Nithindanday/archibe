	It all points one way

**Saturday 5th September (7th year)**

But you like him.

I do not!

Yes, you do.

Not.

I see the way you look at him, in your eyes there is so much hate but behind the hate is so much longing.

No there is not. There can't be. He's a toe rag. I keep hexing him to an oblivion. He's mean to Severus. He's friends with Black. He's desperate. He's arrogant. I detest him!

See, you could only talk about someone you love with so much hate.

Bu- Bu-b-b-b-b-

Remember learning the Patronus charm.

**Of course I remember, (thought Lily) how could I forget!**

**Three months previously **

"Okay class, today we will be starting our work on a subject I know that you have all been looking forward to. The Patronus Charm!" Professor Silvier, the defence against the dark arts professor, announced happily .The whole class smiled.

"Now think of the happiest memory you can.

I thought of the night's my mum would sing me to sleep.

"And say, Expecto Patronum.'

"Expecto Patronum." Repeated the whole class. For most, only a small wisp of light showed but two of us managed. A stag and a doe filled the room with light. I looked round to find who was the owner of the stag and was shocked to see it was Potter. Being me, I'd done some extra reading on the charm and I had found out that compatible patronuses were usually the sign of a love bond. A love bond was formed when two people loved each other so much that they would jump in- front of the killing curse for the other person. Love bonds were not un- common but they usually formed at the birth of a married couples first child.

*****************************************************************************************************************************  
'Fine Alice, If you're so sure I'll try.' And before Alice could say anything, Lily stormed down the stairs to the common room where almost all of the upper school (5,6,7) were. She walked over to where the Marauders were. When James saw her coming towards them he smirked and said,

'Hey Evans, what are you doing over he-' he was cut off when she pressed her lips against his and held on to him to keep them pressed flush together. After a couple of seconds, James got into the kiss and started to dominate it, turning them round and shoving her against the wall, never breaking the kiss. He bit lightly on her lower lip and with a moan, she opened her mouth. James immediately pushed his tongue into the space and explored every inch of her mouth. She broke the kiss off and whispered,

'My dorm. NOW' and James was only too happy to comply. Think what you like about what happened up there. It probably did. They didn't come out for a couple of days.

**An: **This is my first fic. Review please. I like comments good and bad. But please no flames.
